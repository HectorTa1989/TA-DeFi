# TA-DeFi: TRON P2P Lending Platform

A decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform built on the TRON blockchain that lets users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies directly, without intermediaries. This platform allows users to deposit TRC20 tokens as collateral, borrow against their collateral, repay loans, and earn interest on their deposits.
Let's start with a high-level system design and then dive into the code structure.

Now, let's break down the components and their responsibilities:

Frontend dApp: React-based web application
Backend Server: Node.js with Express
Smart Contracts: Solidity contracts deployed on TRON
Database: PostgreSQL for off-chain data
Event Listener: Monitors blockchain events
TRON Node: Connects to the TRON network
IPFS: Stores larger data files
Oracle Service: Provides external data (e.g., token prices)

Next, let's create a code structure for our application using object-oriented programming principles and focusing on high scalability.

I'd be happy to help you design a decentralized application (dApp) that integrates with the TRON/BTTC blockchain. Based on your requirements, let's create a DeFi application that provides accessible financial resources. We'll design a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies directly, without intermediaries.

The code structure provides a high-level overview of the main components of our P2P lending platform. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

## Smart Contracts:

LendingPool: Handles deposits, borrows, repayments, and withdrawals.
PriceOracle: Manages token prices for collateral calculation.


## Backend:

LendingService: Interfaces with the smart contracts to perform lending operations.
UserService: Manages user data and balances.
EventListenerService: Listens for blockchain events and updates the backend accordingly.


## Frontend:

LendingDApp: Provides the user interface for interacting with the platform.


## Main Application:

P2PLendingPlatform: Orchestrates all the components and services.

## Features

Deposit TRC20 tokens as collateral
Borrow against collateral
Repay loans
Withdraw collateral
Liquidation mechanism for undercollateralized positions
Real-time price oracle integration

## Technology Stack

Smart Contracts: Solidity
Blockchain: TRON
Backend: Node.js with Express
